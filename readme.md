## Croatia Student Apartment Renting

CSAR is an open-source student project with simple but yet powerful initiative to ease student life by creating web-application for apartment renting. Application is meant to connect students with
its respective potential lessors. What makes this web-application different from the competition is an agency blocker. By this blocking, students are in direct communication with the lessors, avoiding the agencies and additional fees. 

CSAR will be free of charge!
